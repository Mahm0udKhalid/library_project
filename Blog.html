    <header>WHY READING BOOKS?</header>

        <p>
            Studies show that reading for pleasure makes a big difference to children’s educational performance. Here’s
            how
            you can get your child off to a great start.

            Evidence suggests that children who read for enjoyment every day not only perform better in reading tests
            than
            those who don’t, but also develop a broader vocabulary, increased general knowledge and a better
            understanding
            of other cultures.

            In fact, reading for pleasure is more likely to determine whether a child does well at school than their
            social
            or economic background.

            “The more you read, the more things you know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” This is a
            famous quote by Dr Suess. And it’s 100% accurate. The importance of reading skills cannot be stressed
            enough. As
            a teacher, I often find that when I express my concern about a child’s reading ability and comprehension to
            parents, particularly at around the age of 10, parents are quite taken aback and I’m greeted with “but
            they’re
            so young, give them a chance.” When a teacher shows concern in this area, it is with due cause. Reading is
            fundamental in helping us find and convey information. It’s an essential skill that’s developed at a very
            young
            age. Here’s why reading is beneficial to all of us, and how the importance of reading comprehension is
            essential
            to understanding the world around us.

        <h1>The benefits of reading
        </h1>
        <p>Reading has many benefits, but it’s a skill that even a lot of adults don’t use enough. Apart from the
            necessity
            of reading to get by in today’s world, let’s look at some other benefits of reading and how these can
            contribute
            positively to your child’s development.</p>

        <h1>Reading helps you discover the world
        </h1>
        <p>Reading is a gateway to learning anything about everything. It helps you discover new things and educate
            yourself
            in any area of life you are interested in. You can find a book on just about any subject you can imagine,
            dive
            in and start learning. Your child can learn about their interests (and even themselves) through reading
            things
            they enjoy.</p>

        <h1>Reading develops your imagination and creativity
        </h1>
        <p>When we watch television or a movie, all the information is given to us on the screen – there’s nothing we
            need
            to imagine. A book in its pure form is just words on a page, and our minds have to do the work, imagining
            the
            words coming to life. This does wonders to develop our creativity and imagination.</p>

        <h1>Reading improves vocabulary and communication
        </h1>
        <p>Giving your child access to a world of words is one of the best ways to improve their vocabulary and enhance
            their spelling skills. New knowledge that’s gained through enjoyment has a tendency to stick and doesn’t
            even
            feel like work! Both their written and spoken communication abilities can be improved through regular
            reading.

        </p>
        <h1>Reading helps with building a good self-image and playing well with others</h1>
        <p>Learning new concepts, discovering exciting places and understanding others’ perspectives is key to building
            a
            well-rounded self-image – not to mention the self-esteem boost from being able to read well! It’s at early
            ages
            that children can be most easily influenced, and a positive reading experience can do wonders to help them
            form
            a positive perception of themselves. Reading also has social benefits. Children can discuss stories with
            others
            and form friendships over shared interests.

        </p>

        <h1>Reading improves concentration and reduces stress
        </h1>
        <p>Not only does reading focus your attention entirely on the task at hand, it also immerses you in the
            information,
            improving concentration and memory of what you read. Getting completely involved in a book can help us relax
            and
            feel calm.
